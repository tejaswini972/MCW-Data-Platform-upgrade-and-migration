## Exercise 1: Configure SQL Server instances

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure SQL Server 2008 R2 on the SqlServer2008 VM. The database on this VM will act as the customer's existing "on-premises" database for this hands-on lab.

### Task 1: Connect to the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you will create an RDP connection to the SqlServer2008 VM.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** in the Azure services list, enter your resource group name (hands-on-lab-SUFFIX) into the filter box, and select it from the list.

   ![Resource groups is selected in the Azure navigation pane, "hands" is entered into the filter box, and the "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

2. In the list of resources for your resource group, select the SqlServer2008 VM.

   ![The list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group are displayed, and SqlServer2008 is highlighted.](media/resource-group-resources-sqlserver2008r2.png "SqlServer2008 VM in resource group list")

3. On the SqlServer2008 blade, select Connect from the top menu.

   ![The SqlServer2008 blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](media/connect-sqlserver2008r2.png "Connect to SqlServer2008")

   - **Password**: Password.1!!

7. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-sqlserver2008r2.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

### Task 2: Install AdventureWorks sample database

In this task, you will install the AdventureWorks database in SQL Server 2008 R2. It will act as the "on-premises" data warehouse database that you will migrate to Azure SQL Database.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open a web browser, and navigate to the GitHub site containing the sample AdventureWorks 2008 R2 database at ```https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks2008r2```

2. Scroll down under Assets, and select `adventure-works-2008r2-dw.script.zip`.

   ![The adventure-works-2008r2-dw-script.zip download link is highlighted under Assets for the sample database.](./media/adventure-works-2008-r2-sample-download.png "Assets list")

3. Save the file, and unzip the downloaded file to a folder you create, called `C:\AdventureWorksSample`.

4. Open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** (SSMS) on the SqlServer2008 VM. It can be found under Start->All Programs->Microsoft SQL Server Tools 17.

5. Connect to the **SQLSERVER2008** database, if you are not already connected. In the Connect to Server dialog, leave Authentication set to **Windows Authentication**, and select **Connect**.

10. Select **OK** to close the Options dialog.

11. In the SSMS query editor for `instawdwdb.sql`, uncomment the `SETVAR` lines (lines 36 and 37) by removing the double hyphen "--" from the beginning of each line.

12. Next, edit the file path for each variable so they point to the following (remember to include a trailing backslash ("\\") on each path):

    - SqlSamplesDatabasePath: `C:\AdventureWorksSample\`

    - SqlSamplesSourceDataPath: `C:\AdventureWorksSample\AdventureWorks 2008R2 Data Warehouse\`

      ![The variables and file paths specified above are highlighted in the SSMS query editor.](./media/ssms-query-editor-instawdwdb.png "Edit the variable file paths")
