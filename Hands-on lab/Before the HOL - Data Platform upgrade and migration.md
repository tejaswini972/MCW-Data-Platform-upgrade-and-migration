# Data Platform upgrade and migration before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
  
- A virtual machine configured with:

  - Visual Studio Community 2017 or later
  
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2017)

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 45 minutes

In the Before the hands-on lab exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment **before attending** the hands-on lab. Failure to do so will significantly impact your ability to complete the lab within the time allowed.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab you will see the word “SUFFIX” as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups**, select **+Add**, then enter the following in the Create an empty resource group blade:

    - **Resource group name**: Enter hands-on-lab-SUFFIX.

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

    - **Resource group location**: Select the region you would like to use for resources in this hands-on lab. Remember this location so you can use it for the other resources you'll provision throughout this lab.

        ![Add Resource group Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, +Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and "hands-on-labs" is entered into the Resource group name box on the Create an empty resource group blade.](./media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

2. Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create lab virtual machine

In this task, you will provision a virtual machine (VM) in Azure. The VM image used will have Visual Studio Community 2017 installed.

    ![The SQL Database blade is displayed, with the values specified above entered into the appropriate fields.](media/azure-sql-database-create.png "Create Azure SQL Database")

3. Select **Create**.

    > **Note**: The [Azure SQL Database firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure) prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server or any database on the server unless a firewall rule is created to open the firewall for the specific IP address. When creating the new server above, the **Allow azure services to access server** box was checked, which allows any services using an Azure IP address to access this server and databases, so there is no need to create a specific firewall rule for this hands-on lab. To access the SQL server from an on-premises computer or application, you need to [create a server level firewall rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-get-started-portal#create-a-server-level-firewall-rule) to allow the specific IP addresses to access the server.

### Task 9: Register the Microsoft DataMigration resource provider
