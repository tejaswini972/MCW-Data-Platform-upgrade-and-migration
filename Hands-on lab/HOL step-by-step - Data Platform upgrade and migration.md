# Data Platform upgrade and migration hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a proof of concept (POC) for conducting a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You will evaluate the dependent applications and reports that will need to be updated and come up with a migration plan. In addition, you will help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency, as well as conduct a migration from an old version of SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design and build a database migration plan and implement any required application changes associated with changing database technologies.

## Overview

World Wide Importers (WWI) has experienced significant growth in the last few years. In addition to predictable growth, they’ve had a substantial amount of growth in the data they store in their data warehouse. Their data warehouse is starting to show its age; slowing down during extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations and during critical queries. It was built on SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition.

The WWI CIO has recently read about new performance enhancements of Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2017. She is excited about the potential performance improvements related to clustered ColumnStore indexes. She is also hoping that table compression will improve performance and backup times.

WWI is concerned about upgrading their database to Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017. The data warehouse has been successful for a long time. As it has grown, it has filled with data, stored procedures, views, and security. WWI wants assurance that if it moves its data store, it won’t run into any incompatibilities with the storage engine of Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017.

WWI’s CIO would like a POC of a data warehouse move and proof that the new technology will help ETL and query performance.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram is divided in to Microsoft Azure, and On Premises. Microsoft Azure includes SQL Server 2017 in a VM as an Always On Secondary, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse for a stretch table. On Premise includes the following elements: API App for vendor connections; Web App for Internet Sales Transactions; ASP.NET Core App for inventory management; SQL Server 2017 OLTP for Always On and JSON store; SSRS 2017 for Reporting of OLTP, Data Warehouse, and Cubes; SSIS 2017 for a Data Warehouse Load; Excel for reporting; SQL Server 2017 Enterprise for a Data Warehouse; and SSAS 2017 for a Data Warehouse. ](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to perform an assessment to see what potentials issues need to be addressed in upgrading the database to SQL Server 2017 or Azure SQL Database. After correcting any issues, the SQL Server 2008 database is migrated to Azure SQL Database, using the Azure Database Migration Service. Two features of Azure SQL Database, Table Compression and ColumnStore Index, will be applied to demonstrate value and performance improvements from the upgrade. For the ColumnStore Index, a new table based on the existing FactResellerSales table will be created, and a ColumnStore index applied. Next, the Oracle XE database supporting the application will be migrated to an on-premises SQL Server 2017 Enterprise instance using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) 7.x for Oracle. Once the Oracle database has been migrated, the NorthwindMVC application will be updated, so it targets SQL Server 2017 instead of Oracle. The entity models are updated against SQL Server, and code updates are made to use the new Entity Framework context based on SQL Server. Corrections to stored procedures are made due to differences in how stored procedures are accessed in Oracle versus SQL Server.

4. In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, change the **Log On user** to use the demouser account, by entering **demouser** into the Account Name box, then entering the password, **Password.1!!**, into the Password and Confirm password boxes.

    ![The above credentials are highlighted in the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog box.](media/sql-server-2017-configuration-manager-sql-server-mssqlserver-properties.png "Enter demouser credentials")

5. Select **OK**.

6. Select **Yes** to restart the service in the **Confirm Account Change** dialog.

7. Verify the **SQL Server (SQLSERVER2008)** instance is using the demouser account. If not, repeat steps 3 - 6 above to set the server account to demouser for that instance as well.

8. While still in the SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**, select **Protocols for MSSQLSERVER**, and double-click **TCP/IP** to open the properties dialog.

    ![Protocols for MSSQLSERVER is highlighted on the left side of SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager, and TCP/IP is highlighted in the Protocol Name list on the right.](./media/sql-server-2017-configuration-manager-protocols-for-mssqlserver.png "Select TCP/IP")

    ![Enabled is selected on the Protocol tab of the TCP/IP Properties dialog box.](./media/sql-server-2017-configuration-manager-protocols-tcp-ip-properties.png "Enable TCP/IP")

10. When prompted that the changes will not take effect until the service is restarted, select **OK**. You will restart the service later.

11. Now, select **Protocols for SQLSERVER2008**, double-click **TCP/IP** to open the properties dialog.

12. As you did above, set **Enabled** to **Yes**.

13. Next, select the **IP Addresses** tab within the TCP/IP Properties dialog.

14. On the IP Addresses tab, scroll down to the IPAll section, and note the port number assigned in the **TCP Dynamic Ports** field.  **Note: If the value is 0, you may need to restart the SQL Server (SQLSERVER2008) service first, and then return to this screen.** Copy the value into a text editor, such as Notepad, for later use. SQL Server 2008 R2 was installed as a Named Instance, so it was assigned a dynamic port number, different than 1433 which is typically assigned to SQL Server instances. You will need this port number to create an inbound port rule for the SqlServerDw VM to allow the Azure Database Migration Service to access the SQL Server 2008 database.

    ![The IP Addresses tab of the TCP/IP Properties dialog is displayed, with TCP Dynamic Ports highlighted under the IPAll section.](media/tcp-ip-properties-ip-addresses-tab.png "TCP/IP Properties IP Addresses tab")

15. Select **OK** to close the TCP/IP Properties dialog. When prompted that the changes will not take effect until the service is restarted, select **OK**. You will restart the service later.

16. As done previously, select **SQL Server Services** in the tree on the left, then right-click **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** in the services pane, and select **Restart**.

    ![SQL Server Services is highlighted on the left side of SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager, SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) is highlighted on the right, and Restart is highlighted in the submenu.](./media/sql-server-2017-configuration-manager-sql-server-services-sql-server-restart.png "Select Restart")

17. Repeat the previous step for the **SQL Server (SQLSERVER2008)** service.

18. Repeat the previous step for the **SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER)** service, this time selecting **Start** from the menu.

    ![SQL Server Services is highlighted on the left side of SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager, SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER) is highlighted on the right, and Start is highlighted in the submenu.](./media/sql-server-2017-configuration-manager-sql-server-services-sql-server-agent-restart.png "Select Start")

19. Close the SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager.

### Task 5: Add inbound port rule

In this task, you will add an inbound port rule for the SqlServerDw VM, to allow the dynamic port used by the SQL Server 2008 R2 Named Instance.

## Exercise 3: Post upgrade enhancement

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will confirm that the POC was successful. To demonstrate value from the upgrade, the Azure SQL Database features, Table Compression and ColumnStore Index, will be enabled to immediately show benefit.

### Task 1: Table compression

1. Open SSMS on the SqlServerDw VM, and connect to your Azure SQL Database.

2. Open a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar.

    ![The New Query icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-new-query.png "SSMS New Query")

3. Copy the script below, and paste it into the query window:

    ```sql
    USE [WorldWideImporters]

    -- Get the Size of the FactInternetSales table
    SELECT
    t.Name AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RowCounts,
    CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
    FROM sys.tables t
    INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
    INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
    INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
    WHERE t.Name = 'FactInternetSales'
    GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
    GO
    ```

4. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query to retrieve the size of the `FactInternetSales` table.

    ![The Execute icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-execute-query.png "Select Execute")

5. In the results pane, note the size of the `FactInternetSales` table.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the uncompressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-uncompressed-size.png "Query results")

6. In the Object Explorer, expand Databases, WorldWideImporters, and Tables.

    ![Databases is highlighted in Object Explorer, WorldWideImporters is highlighted below that, and then Tables is highlighted below that.](./media/ssms-object-explorer-tables.png "Select Tables")

7. Right-click the `FactInternetSales` table, select the **Storage** context menu, and then select **Manage Compression** from the fly-out menu.

    ![The FactInternetSales table is selected on the left, Storage is selected and highlighted in the submenu, and Manage Compression is highlighted on the right.](./media/ssms-table-storage-context-menu.png "Select Manage Compression")

8. On the Welcome page of the Data Compression Wizard, select **Next**.

9. On the Select Compression Type page, select **Row** from the Compression Type drop down, and select **Next**.

    ![The Row compression type is highlighted on the Select Compression Type screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-compression-type-row.png "Data Compression Wizard Select Compression Type")

10. On the Select an Output Option page, select **Run immediately**, and then select **Finish >>|**.

    ![Run immediately is highlighted on the Select an Output Option screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-output-row-compression.png "Data Compression Wizard Select an Output Option")

11. Select **Finish** on the Summary page.

    ![The Summary screen of the Data Compression Wizard is displayed.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-summary-row-compression.png "Data Compression Wizard Summary")

12. Close the Data Compression Wizard, and rerun the query to get the size of the `FactInternetSales` table, noting the reduced size of the table.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the row compressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-row-compression-size.png "Query results")

13. Now, repeat steps 7 - 12 above, this time setting the Compression type to Page.

    ![The Page compression type is highlighted on the Select Compression Type screen of the Data Compression Wizard](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-compression-type-page.png "Data Compression Wizard Select Compression Type")

14. Once again, observe the table size in the results pane, and compare it to the values noted for the uncompressed table and with Row compression applied.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the page compressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-page-compression-size.png "Query results")

15. Both Row and Page compression reduce the size of the table, but page compression provides the greatest reduction in this case. Compression decreases the load on the Disk I/O subsystem, while increasing the load on the CPU. Since most data warehouse workloads are heavily disk bound, and often have low CPU usage, compression can be a great way to improve performance.

### Task 2: Clustered ColumnStore index

In this task, you will create a new table based on the existing `FactResellerSales` table and apply a ColumnStore index.

1. In SSMS, ensure you are connected to the Azure SQL Database instance.

2. Open a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar.

    ![The New Query icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-new-query.png "SSMS New Query")

3. Copy the script below, and paste it into the query window:

    ```sql
    USE WorldWideImporters

    SELECT *
    INTO ColumnStore_FactResellerSales
    FROM FactResellerSales
    GO
    ```

4. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query, and create a new table named `ColumnStore_FactResellerSales`, populated with data from the `FactResellerSales` table.

    ![The Execute icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-execute-query.png "Select Execute")

5. Select **New Query** in the toolbar again, and paste the following query into the new query window. The query contains multiple parts; one to get the size of the `ColumnStore_FactResellerSales` table, a second to create a clustered ColumnStore index on the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table, and then the size query is repeated to get the size after adding the clustered ColumnStore index.

    ```sql
    USE [WorldWideImporters]

    -- Get the Size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
    SELECT
    t.Name AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RowCounts,
    CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
    FROM sys.tables t
    INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
    INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
    INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
    WHERE t.Name = 'ColumnStore_FactResellerSales'
    GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
    GO

    -- Create a clustered columnstore index on the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
    CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX [cci_FactResllerSales]
    ON [dbo].[ColumnStore_FactResellerSales]
    GO

    -- Get the Size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
    SELECT
    t.Name AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RowCounts,
    CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
    FROM sys.tables t
    INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
    INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
    INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
    WHERE t.Name = 'ColumnStore_FactResellerSales'
    GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
    GO
    ```

6. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query.

7. In the query results, observe the `Size_MB` value of the table before and after the creation of the clustered ColumnStore index. The first value is the size before the index was created, and the second value is the size after the ColumnStore index was created.

    ![The SSMS results pane is displayed, with the size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table highlighted both before and after the creation of the clustered ColumnStore index.](media/ssms-query-results-columnstore-factresellersales-size.png "ColumnStore_FactResellerSales size query results")

    ```sql
    SELECT productkey, salesamount
    FROM ColumnStore_FactResellerSales

    SELECT productkey, salesamount
    FROM FactResellerSales
    ```

10. In the Results pane, select the **Execution Plan** tab. Check the (relative to the batch) percentage value of the two queries and compare them.

    ![The Execution Plan tab is highlighted in the Results pane, 6% is highlighted for Query 1, and 94% is highlighted for Query 2.](./media/ssms-query-results-execution-plan-columnstore-index.png "Compare the two queries")

11. Run the same queries again, but this time set statistics IO on in the query by adding the following to the top of the query window:

    ```sql
    SET STATISTICS IO ON
    GO
    ```

12. Your query should look like:

    ![In the Edit Type Mapping dialog box, numeric(precision, scale) is highlighted under Target type, 10 is highlighted next to Replace with under Precision, and OK is highlighted at the bottom.](./media/ssma-edit-type-mapping-float-to-numeric.png "Change the Target type")

35. Select Apply to save the changes to the `ORDER_DETAILS` table.

36. Now, right-click on the `ORDER_DETAILS` table in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select **Convert Schema**.

37. When prompted that the target exists, select **Overwrite**.

38. **Optional**: Save the project. This can take a while, and is not necessary to complete the hands-on lab.

39. To apply the resultant schema to the Northwind database in SQL Server, use the SQL Server Metadata Explorer to view the Northwind database. Right-click Northwind, and select **Synchronize with Database**.

    ![Synchronize with Database is highlighted in the submenu of the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-synchronize-with-database.png "Select Synchronize with Database")

40. Select **OK** in the Synchronize with the Database dialog.

41. The Synchronize action will result in multiple errors in the Error List, resulting from attempting to add the SSMA assemblies to the Northwind database.

    ![The Errors notification is highlighted at the top of the Errors List window, and the first of multiple errors is selected and highlighted in the Message list.](./media/ssma-synchronize-errors.png "View the errors")

42. These errors are the result of improvements implemented in SQL Server 2017 SQLCLR security model. Specifically, in SQL Server 2017, Microsoft now by default requires that all type of assemblies (SAFE, EXTERNAL_ACCESS, UNSAFE) are authorized for UNSAFE access.

43. For this hands-on lab, you will be adding the assemblies causing the errors to the trusted assembly list, which is synonymous with whitelisting the assemblies. To fix these errors, complete the following:

    - Under the **Northwind** database in the SQL Server Metadata Explorer in SSMA, expand **Assemblies**.

        ![Three items are listed below Assemblies, which is highlighted below the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-assemblies.png "Expand Assemblies")

    - Right-click `SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET`, and select **Save as Script**.

        ![Save as Script is highlighted in the submenu for SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-assemblies-save-as-script.png "Select Save as Script")

    - Save the script to the local machine.

    - Now, you will need to use SSMS on your SqlServerDw VM.

        - Open an RDP connection to your SqlServerDw VM, if one is not already open.

        - Open SSMS 17.

        - Connect to the SQL Server 2017 instance (SqlServerDw), by entering **SqlServerDw** into the Server name field, using Windows Authentication, and selecting **Connect**.

        - Expand **Databases**, right-click on **Northwind**, and select **New Query**.

        - Paste the following query into the new query window, but don't execute it until you complete the steps below:

            ```sql
            USE master;
            GO

            DECLARE @clrName nvarchar(4000) = 'SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET'
            DECLARE @asmBin varbinary(max) = [INSERT BINARY];
            DECLARE @hash varbinary(64);

            SELECT @hash = HASHBYTES('SHA2_512', @asmBin);

            EXEC sys.sp_add_trusted_assembly @hash = @hash, @description = @clrName;
            ```

    - Now, return to your Lab VM, and open the saved `SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.sql` file from the desktop with Notepad.exe.

    - Within the SQL file, locate the line that begins with `CREATE ASSEMBLY`, then locate the word `FROM`. Copy the binary string that appears after `FROM`. This value will span all the way down to the line containing the text `WITH PERMISSION_SET = SAFE`. Be sure not to include any whitespace at the end of the binary value.

    ![The binary string that appears after FROM is highlighted within the SQL file.](./media/assembly-binary-value.png "Copy the binary string")

    - Now, return to SSMS on your SqlServerDw VM, and replace `INSERT BINARY` with the copied binary value. The line should end with ";" and there should be no whitespace before the ";".

    - Execute the query in SSMS.

44. Repeat step 34, this time for the assembly `SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET`. Make sure to replace the `@clrName` variable in the script with the value "SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET".

45. The SSMA assemblies have now been whitelisted in SQL Server 2017.

46. Return to SSMA on your Lab VM, and rerun the **Synchronize with Database** action on the Northwind database. This will create all the schema objects in the SQL Server Northwind database. There should now be no errors, and the Output pane should show **Synchronization operation is complete**.

47. Now you need to migrate the data.

48. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, select **NW** and from the command bar, select **Migrate Data**.

    ![Migrate Data is highlighted in the command bar of Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-toolbar-migrate-data.png "Select Migrate Data")

49. You will be prompted to re-enter your Oracle credentials for use by the migration connection.

    - Recall the Oracle credentials are:

        - **Server name**: localhost

        - **Server port**: 1521

        - **Oracle SID**: XE

        - **User name**: NW

        - **Password**: oracledemo123

    - The SQL Server credentials are:

        - **Server name**: IP address of your SqlServerDw VM (obtained in the essentials area of your VM's blade in Azure portal).

        - **Server port**: [default]

        - **Authentication**: SQL Server Authentication

        - **User name**: sa

        - **Password**: Password.1!!

50. Select **Connect**.

51. After the migration completes, you will be presented with a Data Migration Report, similar to the following:

    ![This is screenshot of an example Data Migration Report.](./media/ssma-data-migration-report.png "View the Data Migration Report")

52. Select **Close** on the migration report.

53. Close SSMA for Oracle.

## Exercise 6: Migrate the Application

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will modify the NorthwindMVC application, so it targets SQL Server 2017 instead of Oracle.

### Task 1: Create a new Entity Model against SQL Server

1. On your Lab VM, return to Visual Studio, and open `Web.config` from the Solution Explorer.

2. Modify the connection string named `SqlServerConnectionString` to match your remote SQL Server credentials.

    - Replace the value of "data source" with your SqlServerDw VM's public IP address.

    - Replace the value of "password" with Password.1!!

    ![The information above is highlighted in Web.config.](./media/visual-studio-web-config-connection-string-sql-server.png "Replace the password value")

3. Build the solution, by selecting Build in the Visual Studio menu, then selecting Build Solution.

4. In the Solution Explorer, expand the Data folder, and select all the files within the folder.

    ![In Solution Explorer, all the files under Data (highlighted) are selected.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-folder.png "Expand the Data folder")

5. Right-click, and choose **Delete**.

    ![Delete is selected in the shortcut menu for all the files listed under Data.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-folder-delete.png "Delete the files")

6. Select **OK** at the confirmation prompt.

    ![In the Add New Item dialog box, Visual C#, Data, ADO.NET Entity Data Model, and DataContext are highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-add-new-data-context.png "Add DataContext")

9. In the wizard's Choose Model Contents dialog, select **Code First from database**, and select **Next**.

    ![Code First from database is highlighted under What should the model contain? in the Entity Data Model Wizard.](./media/visual-studio-entity-data-model-wizard-choose-model.png "Select Code First from database")

10. In the Choose Your Data Connection dialog, select **SqlServerConnectionString (Settings)** from the drop down, and select **Yes, include the sensitive data in the connection string**. **Uncheck Save connection settings in Web.Config**, and select **Next**.

    ![SqlServerConnectionString (Settings) and Yes, include the sensitive data in the connection string are selected and highlighted in the Entity Data Model Wizard, and Save connection settings in Web.Config is cleared.](./media/visual-studio-entity-data-model-wizard-data-connection.png "Choose Your Data Connection settings")

11. If prompted, in the Connect to SQL Server dialog, enter the Password, **Password.1!!**

    ![The password above is entered in the Connect to SQL Server dialog box.](./media/visual-studio-entity-data-model-wizard-connect-to-sql-server.png "Enter the Password")

12. On the Choose Your Database Objects and Settings screen, expand the Tables node, and check **NW** only. Ensure **Pluralize or singularize generated column names** is checked.

    ![The Tables node is selected, and NW is selected and highlighted in the Entity Data Model Wizard. Pluralize or singularize generated column names is also selected.](./media/visual-studio-entity-data-model-wizard-database-objects.png "Choose Your Database Objects and Settings")

13. Select **Finish**, and the model will be generated. This may take a few minutes.

### Task 2: Modify Application Code

1. In Visual Studio, open the file `DataContext.cs` from the Solution Explorer. You may need to collapse the Data folder, and re-expand it after refreshing if you don't see the file listed

    ![DataContext.cs is highlighted under the Data folder in Solution Explorer.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-datacontext.png "Open DataContext.cs")

2. The call to base in the DataContext constructor, at the top of the file, needs to be updated to reflect the correct connection string.

    ![In the DataContext constructor, : base ("name=DataContext") is highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-datacontext-base.png "Update the call to base")

3. Change the line from:

    ```csharp
    : base ("name=DataContext")
    ```

4. To:

    ```csharp
    : base ("name=SqlServerConnectionString")
    ```

5. Save the file.

    ![In the DataContext constructor, : base ("name=SqlServerConnectionString") is highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-datacontext-base-updated.png "Update the call to base")

6. Next, open the file `HomeController.cs`, in the Controllers folder in the Solution Explorer

    ![The HomeController.cs file is selected and highlighted under the Controllers folder in Solution Explorer.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-controllers-home-controller.png "Open HomeController.cs")

7. Comment out the code under the Oracle comment. First, select the lines for the Oracle code, then select the Comment button in the toolbar.

    ![The code under the Oracle comment is highlighted and labeled 1, and the Comment button in the toolbar is highlighted and labeled 2.](./media/visual-studio-home-controller-comment-out-oracle-lines.png "Comment out code")

8. Next, uncomment the code under the SQL Server comment. Select the commented out code, then select the Uncomment button on the toolbar. You may need to click the Uncomment button twice to uncomment the code.

    >**Note**: The lines will change from green to colored text when the comment characters have been removed from the front of each line. This code change is done because of differences in how stored procedures are accessed in Oracle versus Sql Server.

    ![The code under the SQL Server comment is highlighted and labeled 1, and the Uncomment button in the toolbar is highlighted and labeled 2.](./media/visual-studio-home-controller-uncomment-sql-server-lines.png "Uncomment code")

9. Save the changes to `HomeController.cs`.

10. Open the file, `SALESBYYEAR.cs`, in the Models folder in the Solution Explorer.

    ![SALESBYYEAR.cs is highlighted under the Models folder in the Solution Explorer.](./media/visual-studio-models-salesbyyear.png "Open SALESBYYEAR.cs")

11. Change the types of the following properties:

    - Change the `SUBTOTAL` property from double to decimal.

    - Change the `YEAR` property from string to int.

    ![The decimal and int property values are highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-models-salesbyyear-updated.png "Change the SUBTOTAL and YEAR properties")

12. Save the file.

15. Run the solution by selecting the green Start button on the toolbar.

    ![Start is highlighted on the toolbar.](./media/visual-studio-toolbar-start.png "Select Start")

16. You will get an exception that the stored procedure call has failed. This is because of an error in migrating the stored procedure.

    ![An exception appears indicating that the stored procedure call has failed.](./media/visual-studio-exception-sqlexception.png "View the error")

17. Select the red Stop button to end execution of the application.

    ![The Stop button is highlighted on the toolbar.](./media/visual-studio-toolbar-stop.png "Select Stop")

18. To resolve the error, open the `SALES_BY_YEAR_fix.sql` file, located under Solution Items in the Solution Explorer.

19. Note the database name at the top of the file (within the brackets after the `USE` keyword).

    ![NorthwindMigration is displayed as the database name at the top of the file.](./media/visual-studio-sql-file-use-statement-northwindmigration.png "Note the database name")

20. Replace this with the correct database name, **Northwind**, and save the file.
